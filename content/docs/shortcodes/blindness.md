# **Color blindness**

## **Problem statement**

People with colour vision deficiency find it difficult to identify and distinguish between certain colours.

Colour vision deficiency is not usually anything to be concerned about.

Most people get used to it over time, it will not normally get any worse, and it's rarely a sign of anything serious.

But it can sometimes cause issues such as:

- Difficulty at school if colours are used to help with learning
- Problems with food, such as identifying whether meat is fully cooked or whether fruit is ripe
- Getting medications confused if they're not clearly labelled
- Trouble identifying safety warnings or signs
- Slightly limited career choices – certain jobs, such as pilots, train drivers, electricians and air traffic controllers, may require accurate colour recognition

## **Background**

#### **Definition**

Color blindness is a *reduced ability to distinguish between color* when compared to the standard for normal human color vision. When a person is color blind, also called color vision deficiency (CVD), they usually have difficulty distinguishing between certain colors such as yellow and orange, green and brown, pink and gray, or blue and purple.

#### **Types**

- **Red-green** color blindness, which includes protan-type CVD (protanomaly and protanopia) and deutan-type CVD (deuteranomaly and deuteranopia).
- Tritan-type CVD, also called **blue-yellow** color blindness which is associated with the inability to see shades of blue, and confusions between blue and green colors. Blue-yellow color blindness is usually caused by age-related eye conditions such as glaucoma, or exposure to certain chemicals or medical treatments. 
- In very rare cases, a person can be completely color blind, meaning they see only the intensity of light, but not its color. This is called **monochromacy** or achromatopsia.

#### **Solutions**

EnChroma has developed optical lens technology that selectively filters out wavelengths of light at the precise point where the confusion or excessive overlap of color sensitivity occurs. This increases contrast between the red and green color signals, alleviating symptoms of color blindness for a richer experience of the world. 

EnChroma color blind glasses are uniquely engineered to give those with color blindness the ability to see a broader spectrum of bright color. Utilizing a patented light filter technique, EnChroma’s lens technology is applied with mathematical precision to address common forms of red-green colorblindness. Although EnChroma glasses are not a cure, they are helpful for approximately 80% of people with color blindness.

#### **Testing for Color Blindness**

The Ishihara test for color blindness is named after a Japanese ophthalmologist Shinobu Ishihara who invented the test for the Japanese army in 1917. Ishihara has been a good screening test, but it is 100 years old and does not leverage the benefits of today’s computer-based adaptive testing protocols.

## **Conclusions & future work**

- Color blindness affects a large number of individuals, with protans and deutans being the most common types
- Color blindness affects approximately every 1 in 12 men (8%) and 1 in 200 women (0.5%).

In future work, we pretend to develop an app using p5.js in which we can change the colors palette of an image based on the client's Ishihara test results. An idea for this matter is to apply those changes in each vertex color in a platonic solid.
