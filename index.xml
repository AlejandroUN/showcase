I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description></item><item><title>Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll</title><link>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/posts/migrate-from-jekyll/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/posts/migrate-from-jekyll/</guid><description>Move static content to static # Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description></item><item><title>(Hu)go Template Primer</title><link>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/posts/goisforlovers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/posts/goisforlovers/</guid><description>Hugo uses the excellent Go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using Go templates.</description></item><item><title>Getting Started with Hugo</title><link>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/posts/hugoisforlovers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/posts/hugoisforlovers/</guid><description>Step 1. Install Hugo # Go to Hugo releases and download the appropriate version for your OS and architecture.
Save it somewhere specific as we will be using it in the next step.
More complete instructions are available at Install Hugo
Step 2. Build the Docs # Hugo has its own example site which happens to also be the documentation site you are reading right now.
Follow the following steps:</description></item><item><title/><link>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/docs/shortcodes/log/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/docs/shortcodes/log/</guid><description>Logs # March 29th Platonic solid Textured

Colour vision deficiency is not usually anything to be concerned about.
Most people get used to it over time, it will not normally get any worse, and it&amp;rsquo;s rarely a sign of anything serious.
But it can sometimes cause issues such as:
Difficulty at school if colours are used to help with learning Problems with food, such as identifying whether meat is fully cooked or whether fruit is ripe Getting medications confused if they&amp;rsquo;re not clearly labelled Trouble identifying safety warnings or signs Slightly limited career choices – certain jobs, such as pilots, train drivers, electricians and air traffic controllers, may require accurate colour recognition Background # Definition # Color blindness is a reduced ability to distinguish between color when compared to the standard for normal human color vision.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/docs/shortcodes/Workshop1/solids/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/docs/shortcodes/Workshop1/solids/</guid><description> Platonic Solids # A platonic solid is a polyhedron all of whose faces are congruent regular polygons, and where the same number of faces meet at every vertex.

Background # Scene trees # Scene trees are a concept used for the spatial and graphical representation of a scene using matrices and a graph representation, more specifically that of a tree as the graph has no cycles.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/docs/shortcodes/Workshop2/Rasterization/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/docs/shortcodes/Workshop2/Rasterization/</guid><description>Rasterization # Problem statement # What we do with the rasterization process is breaking down a continuous surface (the triangle) into discrete elements (the pixels). The problem is similar to trying to represent a continuous curve or surface with Lego bricks. And the solution to this problem in rendering is called anti-aliasing, that will be implemented using the barycentric coordinates.
Background # Concepts # Rasterization # Rasterization is the task of taking an image described in a vector graphics format (shapes) and converting it into a raster image (a series of pixels, dots or lines, which, when displayed together, create the image which was represented via shapes).</description></item><item><title/><link>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/docs/shortcodes/Workshop3/color-blindness-shader/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/docs/shortcodes/Workshop3/color-blindness-shader/</guid><description> Color brightness tools #</description></item><item><title/><link>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/docs/shortcodes/Workshop3/color-brightness/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/docs/shortcodes/Workshop3/color-brightness/</guid><description> Color brightness tools # Referencias # http://colormine.org/convert/rgb-to-lab https://www.hisour.com/es/lab-color-space-24846/ https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15408522/rgb-to-xyz-and-lab-colours-conversion https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV#Disadvantages https://visualcomputing.github.io/docs/shaders/texturing/</description></item><item><title/><link>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/docs/shortcodes/Workshop3/image-processing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/docs/shortcodes/Workshop3/image-processing/</guid><description> Image processing # Introduction # Background # Methods # Code (solution) &amp;amp; results # Image Processing // Brush controls Conclusions &amp;amp; future work # References # Main Spaces ml5 handpose</description></item><item><title/><link>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/docs/shortcodes/Workshop3/procedural-texturing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/docs/shortcodes/Workshop3/procedural-texturing/</guid><description> Procedural Texturing # Introduction # Background # Methods # Code (solution) &amp;amp; results # Procedrual Texturing // Brush controls Conclusions &amp;amp; future work # References # Main Spaces ml5 handpose</description></item><item><title/><link>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/docs/shortcodes/Workshop3/test/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/docs/shortcodes/Workshop3/test/</guid><description> UV Visualization - TEST #</description></item><item><title/><link>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/docs/shortcodes/Workshop3/uv-visualization/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/docs/shortcodes/Workshop3/uv-visualization/</guid><description> UV Visualization #</description></item></channel></rss>
