I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description></item><item><title>Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll</title><link>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/posts/migrate-from-jekyll/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/posts/migrate-from-jekyll/</guid><description>Move static content to static # Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description></item><item><title>(Hu)go Template Primer</title><link>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/posts/goisforlovers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/posts/goisforlovers/</guid><description>Hugo uses the excellent Go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using Go templates.</description></item><item><title>Getting Started with Hugo</title><link>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/posts/hugoisforlovers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/posts/hugoisforlovers/</guid><description>Step 1.

Tritan-type CVD, also called blue-yellow color blindness which is associated with the inability to see shades of blue, and confusions between blue and green colors. Blue-yellow color blindness is usually caused by age-related eye conditions such as glaucoma, or exposure to certain chemicals or medical treatments.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/docs/shortcodes/blindness/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/docs/shortcodes/blindness/</guid><description>Color blindness # Problem statement # People with colour vision deficiency find it difficult to identify and distinguish between certain colours.
Colour vision deficiency is not usually anything to be concerned about.
Most people get used to it over time, it will not normally get any worse, and it&amp;rsquo;s rarely a sign of anything serious.
But it can sometimes cause issues such as:
Difficulty at school if colours are used to help with learning Problems with food, such as identifying whether meat is fully cooked or whether fruit is ripe Getting medications confused if they&amp;rsquo;re not clearly labelled Trouble identifying safety warnings or signs Slightly limited career choices – certain jobs, such as pilots, train drivers, electricians and air traffic controllers, may require accurate colour recognition Background # Definition # Color blindness is a reduced ability to distinguish between color when compared to the standard for normal human color vision.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/docs/shortcodes/log/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/docs/shortcodes/log/</guid><description>Log # March 29th Platonic solid Textured
