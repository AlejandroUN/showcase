Colour vision deficiency is not usually anything to be concerned about.
Most people get used to it over time, it will not normally get any worse, and it&amp;rsquo;s rarely a sign of anything serious.
But it can sometimes cause issues such as:
Difficulty at school if colours are used to help with learning Problems with food, such as identifying whether meat is fully cooked or whether fruit is ripe Getting medications confused if they&amp;rsquo;re not clearly labelled Trouble identifying safety warnings or signs Slightly limited career choices â€“ certain jobs, such as pilots, train drivers, electricians and air traffic controllers, may require accurate colour recognition Background # Definition # Color blindness is a reduced ability to distinguish between color when compared to the standard for normal human color vision.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/docs/shortcodes/log/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/docs/shortcodes/log/</guid><description>Logs # March 29th Platonic solid Textured

Background # Scene trees # Scene trees are a concept used for the spatial and graphical representation of a scene using matrices and a graph representation, more specifically that of a tree as the graph has no cycles.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/docs/shortcodes/Rasterization/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/docs/shortcodes/Rasterization/</guid><description>Rasterization # #antialiasing { margin: 20px; border: solid 0.5px; border-radius: 5px } .img-right{ width: 120px; float: right; margin: 0px 20px; } Problem statement # What we do with the rasterization process is breaking down a continuous surface (the triangle) into discrete elements (the pixels). The problem is similar to trying to represent a continuous curve or surface with Lego bricks. And the solution to this problem in rendering is called anti-aliasing, that will be implemented using the barycentric coordinates.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/docs/shortcodes/solids/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AlejandroUN.github.io/docs/shortcodes/solids/</guid><description>Platonic Solids # A platonic solid is a polyhedron all of whose faces are congruent regular polygons, and where the same number of faces meet at every vertex.
